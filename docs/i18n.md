# Internationalization (i18n) Strategy

> This document outlines how multilingual support is implemented in the application, focusing on simplicity, clean URLs, and a seamless user experience, especially in Hotwire Native.

---

## Core Principles

1.  **One Source of Truth:** The user's locale is stored in `session[:locale]`. For signed-in users, this is also persisted to `current_user.language`.
2.  **Clean Authenticated URLs:** Routes for signed-in users do **not** include a locale segment (e.g., `/restaurants`, not `/en/restaurants`).
3.  **Public & SEO-Friendly URLs:** Public-facing pages (like the homepage or privacy policy) use a `/:locale` prefix for SEO and shareability.
4.  **Native-First Experience:** Language switching within the Hotwire Native app uses custom Turbo Stream actions to dismiss modal sheets correctly, providing a smooth, app-like feel.

## How It Works

### 1. Routing (`config/routes.rb`)

- A `scope "(:locale)"` block wraps all public-facing routes, making the locale segment optional (e.g., `/fr/pages/privacy`).
- All authenticated routes are defined *outside* this scope, ensuring they never have a locale prefix.

### 2. Setting the Locale (`app/controllers/application_controller.rb`)

- A `set_locale` `before_action` sets the locale on every request based on the following priority:
    1.  `session[:locale]` (if present)
    2.  `current_user.language` (if the user is signed in)
    3.  `I18n.default_locale`

### 3. URL Generation (`default_url_options`)

- To keep authenticated URLs clean, `default_url_options` is configured to **only** add a `locale` parameter to links when the user is **not** signed in.

### 4. Language Switching (`Profiles::LanguagesController`)

- The language switcher is a form that submits the desired locale.
- **For Web:** The controller updates the `session` and the `current_user`, then performs a standard `redirect_to`.
- **For Hotwire Native:** The controller responds with a custom Turbo Stream action (`<turbo-stream action="visit">`). This is handled by a custom JavaScript function (`application.js`) that tells the native shell to dismiss the sheet and navigate to the user's profile, ensuring a smooth transition.
