# BentoBook

## Base Setup

This is a Rails 8 app setup with Vite. We are using Tailwind CSS for styling and Tailwind UI for components. (There are still DaisyUI components present but we will weed them out.)
We use good dev practices Hotwire, Stimulus, Turbo. We also have AlpineJS installed, but just like Daisy UI we will remove it ASAP.

## File Locations

Since this is a Vite / Rails setup, the frontend code is located in the `app/frontend` directory. Javascript controllers are located in the `app/frontend/controllers` directory.

## Some Gems

- Devise for auth
- ViewComponents for some UI
