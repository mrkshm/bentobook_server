        tagline: Remember every place worth going — and who you went with.
        intro: Save restaurants the moment you hear about them. Show nearby restaurants when you’re hungry. See your visit history, photos, and shared moments with the people who matter most.

        story_intro: Every meal tells a story — from the first restaurant you went to with your partner, to the place your friends won’t stop talking about. BentoBook keeps these stories alive and easy to find.
        features: Log restaurants in seconds when you hear about them. Tag them by who recommended them or why they matter. Sort by distance so you always know what’s nearby. See what you ate last time, who you were with, and revisit the memories that made it special.
        mission: "We built BentoBook because we believe your food experiences deserve better than getting lost in endless social feeds or buried in generic review sites. It's an app that respects the personal nature of food while making it easy to share recommendations with the people who matter most."
