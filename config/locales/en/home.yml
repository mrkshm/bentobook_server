What did you order that made you both smile? These moments matter, and BentoBook helps you capture them naturally, without taking you out of the moment.'
        features: 'With BentoBook, you can quickly log where you ate, the meals you enjoyed, and who you were with. Use photos and notes to keep track of special dishes and revisit them anytime. Together with speedy searching and detailed visit records, BentoBook helps you spend less time on your phone and more time experiencing life.'
